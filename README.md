# Image Classification Project  

This project focuses on building an **Image Classification model** using deep learning.  
It uses a pre-trained model (such as **CNN**) to classify images into different categories.  

## Project Structure

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses image data  
- Trains a deep learning model  
- Evaluates accuracy and performance  
- Supports prediction on new images  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

Install dependencies with:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
